Here's a possible algorithm for approximating the surface area of a lava droplet represented as a 3D grid of 1x1x1 cubes:

Initialize a variable to keep track of the total surface area of the droplet.
Loop through each cube in the 3D grid.
For each cube, check its six neighboring cubes in the grid.
If any neighboring cube is outside the bounds of the grid (i.e., has a negative coordinate or a coordinate greater than the size of the grid in that dimension), consider that face of the current cube to be exposed.
If any neighboring cube is not occupied by a lava droplet (i.e., is empty), consider that face of the current cube to be exposed.
If the current cube is at the edge of the grid in any dimension, consider that face to be exposed.
Add up the number of exposed faces for the current cube, and add that to the total surface area.
Repeat steps 2-7 for all cubes in the grid.
Return the total surface area as the approximate surface area of the lava droplet.
Note that this algorithm only provides an approximation of the surface area, based on the assumption that the lava droplet is composed of 1x1x1 cubes. The actual surface area of the droplet could be more or less than this approximation, depending on the specific shape and orientation of the droplet.


Initialize a variable "total_surface_area" to 0.
Loop through each cube in the 3D grid.
For the first cube (2,2,2), check its six neighboring cubes.
The cube at (1,2,2) is outside the bounds of the grid, so consider the face between them to be exposed.
The cube at (3,2,2) is outside the bounds of the grid, so consider the face between them to be exposed.
The cube at (2,1,2) is outside the bounds of the grid, so consider the face between them to be exposed.
The cube at (2,3,2) is outside the bounds of the grid, so consider the face between them to be exposed.
The cube at (2,2,1) is outside the bounds of the grid, so consider the face between them to be exposed.
The cube at (2,2,3) is not empty and is adjacent to the current cube, so this face is not exposed.
The cube at (2,2,4) is outside the bounds of the grid, so consider the face between them to be exposed.
The cube at (2,2,6) is outside the bounds of the grid, so consider the face between them to be exposed.
The cube at (1,2,5) is outside the bounds of the grid, so consider the face between them to be exposed.
The cube at (3,2,5) is outside the bounds of the grid, so consider the face between them to be exposed.
The cube at (2,1,5) is outside the bounds of the grid, so consider the face between them to be exposed.
The cube at (2,3,5) is outside the bounds of the grid, so consider the face between them to be exposed.
Add up the number of exposed faces for this cube, which is 6, and add that to the total surface area.
Repeat steps 3-16 for all other cubes in the grid.
Return the total surface area, which is 64.
